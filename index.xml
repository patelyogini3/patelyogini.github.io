      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hello there, I am Yogini Patel and I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineer Student majoring in Nanoscale System Design at the University of Alberta.
I have always been passionate about computers, software programming and technology as a whole. The thrill of building something I envisioned in my mind and watching it work is something Iâ€™ve always been a fan of. Recently I have been interested in Machine Learning and have been taking out time daily to broaden my knowledge about machine learning and data science.</description>
