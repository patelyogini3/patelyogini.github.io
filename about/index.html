<p>Hello there, I am Yogini Patel and I&rsquo;m a <strong>Computer Engineer Student</strong> majoring in <strong>Nanoscale System Design</strong> at the <strong>University of Alberta</strong>.</p>
<p>I have always been passionate about computers, software programming and technology as a whole.

I am also a huge fan of meaningful conversations may it be about technology or just life in general. I love discussions with people who are driven to <strong>solve important problems</strong>. I’d love to talk with you about your ideas and I can be reached via email.</p>
